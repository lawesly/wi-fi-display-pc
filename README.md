wi-fi-display-pc
================

An application that implements the Wi-Fi Display specification for mirroring a PC's display to a compatible TV or other device. Hopefully after that is complete, mirroring of other devices onto the PC's screen can be implemented.

While the application will not be certified as Miracast compatible, the goal is to get the application working with as many Miracast certified devices as possible.

This application is in the very early stages of development. Contributors are welcome. Please contact me if you are interested in contributing.
